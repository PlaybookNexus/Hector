## 🧠 Hector: Modular Autonomy Mesh

Hector is a remixable autonomy framework for expressive agents, mission choreography, and contributor empowerment. Designed for robotics, sensors, and legal transparency, Hector supports pick/place routines, martial arts flows, and real-time override logic.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 🧱 Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PlaybookNexus/Hector.git
cd Hector
```

### 🐍 Python Environment

Ensure Python 3 is installed. Optionally create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies (if `requirements.txt` is populated):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🧪 Run the Test Harness

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This boots the `RobotArmAgent`, executes a pick routine, and performs a ballet sequence.
