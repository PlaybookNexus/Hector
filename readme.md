# 🧠 Hector: Modular Autonomy Mesh

Hector is a remixable autonomy framework for expressive agents, override choreography, and contributor empowerment. Designed for robotics, sensors, and legal transparency, Hector supports pick/place routines, martial arts flows, and real-time reflex logic.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Raspberry Pi or Linux)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PlaybookNexus/Hector.git
cd Hector
python3 main.py
```

If you see logging errors:

```bash
mkdir logs
```

---

## 🧩 What Hector Does

- Animates routines like ballet, kata, saluting, intercept
- Logs every motion to `logs/motion.log` with emoji and timestamps
- Triggers override and recovery based on agent risk
- Renders a live dashboard with agent status and vector summaries

## 🧠 Remixing Hector

- Add new routines in `dashboard/motions.py`
- Animate with `animate_motion(agent_id, "routine")`
- Log with `log_motion(agent_id, routine, frames)`
- Visualize with `visualizer.py` (coming soon)
